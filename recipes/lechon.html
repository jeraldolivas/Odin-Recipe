        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          A traditional pork dish from Spain, lechón is a suckling pig that's
          roasted. The pig is the star here, so make sure you properly source
          it. This home adaptation of a classic pig roast offers all the flavors
          you want in any pork product but is spiked with the delicious
          citrus-herbiness of the mojo. You can make the mojo up to 3 days
          ahead. You'll need an injection needle which can be found in the BBQ
          section of grocery stores.

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Place garlic, cilantro, oregano, salt, pepper, cumin, and 1/2 cup of
            the oil in a blender. Slowly add orange and lime juice, and pulse
            until smooth, 10 to 12 times. Remove 1 cup marinade mixture, and
            reserve for later use.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place pig in a container that is large enough to accommodate its
            size. Thoroughly coat with remaining marinade mixture, rubbing all
            over pig. Cover container, and chill 8 to 24 hours, basting
            occasionally.
          </li>
          <li>
            Preheat oven to 275°F. Place a wire rack in a large, aluminum
            foil-lined rimmed baking sheet or roasting pan. Remove pig from
            marinade, and place on rack, discarding marinade.
          </li>
          <li>
            Inject pig all over with reserved 1 cup marinade mixture, and rub
            with remaining 1 cup oil. Roast pig in preheated oven until a meat
            thermometer inserted into the shoulder joint close to the head
            registers 160°F, about 4 hours, rotating pan, if necessary. Increase
            oven temperature to 425°F, and roast until skin is golden brown and
            crispy, about 1 hour. Let rest 20 minutes. Serve immediately.
